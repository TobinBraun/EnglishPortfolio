                    <p class="text">Dear Mr. King,</p>
                    <p class="text">Hello, my name is Tobin, and I am a student at Waterloo Collegiate Institute. I am writing to you because I listened to your five Massey Lectures in my Indigenous Studies class. They changed my views on several Indigenous issues. As a White settler, my only knowledge of Indigenous people was from elementary school social studies. Your lectures have opened my eyes to the many issues they still face today.</p>
                    <p class="text">In your lectures, you outlined the many ways that Indigenous people are still discriminated against. As a White settler, what do you think is the best way for me to help address the struggles that Indigenous people face?</p>
                    <p class="text">In your seminar “You’re Not the Indian I Had in Mind”, you explored the idea of “what is an Indigenous person”. Edward Curtis had the idea of the imaginary Indian who was very romanticized. I’m wondering what you think an Indigenous person is. Is it someone who has Indigenous blood, someone who practices Indigenous culture, or something else?</p>
                    <p class="text">In your fifth seminar, you said, “And legislation, in relation to Native people, has two goals. One, to relieve us of our land, and two, to legalize us out of existence” (King 120). There are clearly some significant issues with the current legislation regarding Indian Status. I’m wondering, if you had the power to change the laws about Indian Status, what would you do with it? Would you remove the two-generation cut-off clause? Would you relax the qualifications? Or would you allow anyone to identify as Indigenous by removing Indian Status?</p>
                    <p class="text">I have learned many things from your seminars, but my biggest takeaway is the importance of stories. In all of your lectures, you say, “The truth about stories is that that’s all we are” (King 5). Before listening to your lectures, I knew that stories are important, but I only thought of them as tools to pass on knowledge and for entertainment. I did not realize that stories make up one’s identity. Now, I know that stories can define how one acts and what they believe in. The fact that you say this in every seminar reinforces its importance.</p>
                    <p class="text">Another thing that I learned was how Indigenous people were heavily romanticized in the nineteenth century. When the first colonists came to North America, many Indigenous people died from starvation and disease. Many falsely believed that Indigenous people were a "dying race." This led many to romanticize Indigenous people. So, many writers wrote stories of "heroic but savage" Indigenous people. The following quote taught me about how people think of Indigenous people: “Prior to the nineteenth century, the prevalent image of the Indian had been that of an inferior being. The Romantics imagined their Indian as dying. But in that dying, in that passing away, in that disappearing from the stage of human progress, there was also a sense of nobility” (King 33). This quote helped me realize that the image of minority groups can become whatever the majority population (white settlers) wants it to be.</p>
                    <p class="text">I learned the most in the fifth seminar “What is it About that You Don’t Like?” because I knew next to nothing about Status before listening to it. I learned that even though a person can be 100% Indigenous by blood, the law might not consider them “Indian”. I also learned that losing Status can strip an Indigenous person of many rights that "Status Indians" have. For example, it would ban them from labeling their art as "made by an Indigenous person" and from living on a reserve. Losing Status can harm one's identity. Not being legally Indigenous, they might feel they don't deserve to call themselves Indigenous.</p>
                    <p class="text">Sincerely,</p>
                    <p class="text">Tobin</p>
